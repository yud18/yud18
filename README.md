Hi! 👋 I'm Dimas.
An independent Software Engineer who loves to create and share projects about web and mobile technology! I've enjoyed JavaScript and make it the main language in creating a project.

I'm currently active in contributing as Curriculum Developer at @dicodingacademy to build courses in Front-End Apps (Web, Android) and Back-End Service.

🔭 I’m currently working on @dicodingacademy
🌱 I’m currently learning about cloud technology for back-end apps
